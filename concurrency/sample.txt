We have learnt that structs can contain data.
structs can also contain behavior in the form of methods. 
The definition of a method attached to or associated with a struct 
or any other type for that matter, is quite similar to a 
normal func definition, the only difference being that you need to 
additionally specify the type.
Many object oriented languages have a concept of this or self that implicitly
refers to the current instance. Go has no such keyword. 
When defining a function or method associated with a type, 
it is given as a named variable - in this case 
and then within the function the variable r is used.
In the above call to Area, the instance of Rectangle 
is passed as a value. You could also pass it by reference. 
In calling the function, there would be no difference whether 
the instance that you call it with is a pointer or a value 
because Go will automatically do the conversion for you.
GO Language is a statically compiled programming language, 
It is an open-source language. It was designed at Google by 
Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Grieserner. It is also known as 
Golang. Go language is a general-purpose programming language mainly 
meant for building large scale complex software.
Further, the water is polluted in the name of industrial development, 
religious practices and more will cause a shortage of drinking water. 
Without water, human life is not possible. Moreover, the way waste is dumped 
on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns toxic. If land pollution 
keeps on happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. 
Therefore, serious measures must be taken to reduce pollution to the core.
Pollution affects the quality of life more than one can imagine. 
It works in mysterious ways, sometimes which cannot be seen by the naked eye. However, 
it is very much present in the environment. For instance, you might not be able to see 
the natural gases present in the air, but they are still there. 
Similarly, the pollutants which are messing up the air and 
increasing the levels of carbon dioxide is very dangerous for humans. 
Increased level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming.
